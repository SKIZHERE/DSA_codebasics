# 4. Now you don't like thor and hulk because they get angry easily :)
#    So you want to remove thor and hulk from list and replace them with doctor strange (because he is cool).
#    Do that with one line of code.

heros = ['spider man', 'thor', 'hulk', 'black panther', 'iron man', 'captain america']

heros[1:3] = ['doctor strange']

print(heros)
