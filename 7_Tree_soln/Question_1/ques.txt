Extent tree class built in our main tutorial so that it takes name and designation in data part of TreeNode class. Now extend print_tree function such that it can print either name tree, designation tree or name and designation tree. As shown below,



Here is how your main function should will look like,

if __name__ == '__main__':
    root_node = build_management_tree()
    root_node.print_tree("name") # prints only name hierarchy
    root_node.print_tree("designation") # prints only designation hierarchy
    root_node.print_tree("both") # prints both (name and designation) hierarchy
